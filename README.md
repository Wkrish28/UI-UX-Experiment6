# UI-UX-Experiment6
## Aim:

To design a complete UX workflow for a Fitness Tracking & Workout Planning Application, covering ideation, user stories, scenarios, user flows, and information architecture.

## Algorithm:

Identify the core UX problem users face in fitness apps.

Conduct solution ideation using Crazy 8’s (8 ideas in 8 minutes).

Create user stories based on a selected persona.

Develop a scenario describing the user’s emotional, environmental, and task-based journey.

Create a flow diagram representing the user's navigation steps.

Perform card sorting and develop the Information Architecture (IA) and site map.

## Output:
1. Solution Ideation

Problem:
Users struggle to maintain consistent workouts due to confusing navigation, lack of personalization, and overwhelming data.

Method: Crazy 8’s Ideation
Eight quick ideas generated in 8 minutes:

One-tap Start Workout button on the home screen.

AI Auto-Generate Workout Plans based on goals.

Simplified Weekly Score Graphs to track progress.

Voice Command Mode (“Start leg workout”).

Streak-based Habit Reminders.

Combined Workout Timer + Form Tips screen.

Gamified Challenges with points and badges.

Offline Workout Tracking mode.

2. Creating User Stories

## Persona:
Rahul, 21, college student and fitness beginner who wants simple, fast, and motivating workouts.

User Stories:

As a beginner, I want simple categories so that I don’t feel overwhelmed.

As a busy student, I want 20-minute workouts so that I can stay consistent.

As a fitness learner, I want video demos so that I can exercise safely.

As a motivated user, I want streak tracking so that I stay encouraged.

As a returning user, I want the app to remember my last workout so that I can resume quickly.

3. Creating Scenarios

User Story Selected:
“As a busy student, I want workouts under 20 minutes so that I can stay consistent.”

Scenario:
Rahul returns from college exhausted but wants to exercise. He opens the fitness app looking for something short. The home screen highlights Quick 20-Minute Workouts, which relieves him. He selects a Full Body session, checks a demo video, and starts the built-in workout timer. Voice cues guide him throughout. After completing the routine, he earns a streak badge and feels accomplished.

Emotional States:
Tired → Motivated → Accomplished

Environment:
Bedroom after college

Tasks:
Open app → Select Quick Workouts → Choose routine → Watch demo → Start timer → Finish → Log workout
